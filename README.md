# Push_swap

This project sorts integers on a stack datatype, with a limited set of instructions.

The goal of this project is to learn how to succesfully manipulate various types of searching/sorting algorithms. And to choose the most appropriate solution for your complexity needs.

## Todo

- Replace sort_three function with beta function. Make sure stacks of three are sorted correctly within two moves.
- Create new sort_five function that uses pa + pa + sort_three(stack_a) + [[ new functions written to merge from stack_b into stack_a ]]
